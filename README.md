= A git tutorial

This is a tutorial for using git I put together for the [NYU Computational
Cognition Lab](http://nyuccl.org). It's designed for people who have never used
any VCS, or who are coming from a different kind of VCS like Subversion or
Darcs. I go through basic commands for commiting and pushing to remote
repositories, then try to explain branching through a bunch of graphs lifted
from progit.
